As long as this nodejs app is running, received block will be stored in files:

blocks-124-0.json (124 is the epoch, 0 is the node index)
blocks-124-1.json (124 is the epoch, 1 is the node index)
blocks-124-2.json (124 is the epoch, 2 is the node index)
blocks-124-3.json (124 is the epoch, 3 is the node index)
blocks-124-all.json (124 is the epoch, blocks from all nodes)

Each line of those files is a valid json object.
